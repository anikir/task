I am sharing only base class , tc1 class and readme file.
I have covered some testcases in tc1 by inherating base class 
I used dataprovider where I provided blood glucose level (mg/dl) reading.(some of cases are hardcoded just to complete given scenario)

Instructions;
1. provide valid chrome driver path in base class.
2. provide valid username in tc1 class.
3. system should have testng and selenium jars.
